For question 1, PLEASE NOTE: the sample test \(\(\(1.56+4.26\)*\(x1-2.23\)\)/x2\) completely works fine in my macbook. But when i input it in nomachine, it breaks my program for some reason. Please keep note of this. my tree completely works but i have not displayed it. It parses the function. Options 2, 3, 4 work as well. I did not have time for it.

For question 2, everything works fine. My heapsort works.
