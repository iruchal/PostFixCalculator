The program takes as input an arithmetic expression
of binary operators +, −, ∗, /, and converts the expression into a binary expression tree. The
program takes input from the command line.

The program should then show a menu with the following options:
1. Display
2. Preorder
3. Inorder
4. Postorder

To to pass (((1.56+4.26)*(x1-2.23))/x2) to a program, the argument should
be \(\(\(1.56+4.26\)*\(x1-2.23\)\)/x2\)
